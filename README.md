# 🚀 Machine Learning Model Deployment using Streamlit

Developed During Data Science Internship at Unified Mentor Private Limited

# 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building, training, and deploying a Machine Learning model using Python, Scikit-learn. The end goal was to create a fully interactive web application where users can input values and get predictions instantly.

This project was developed as part of my 6-month Data Science Internship at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.

# 🧠Key EDA Insights

**Top Installed Categories:**

Game, Communication, Social, Productivity, Tools

**Rating Patterns:Category Rating Comparison:**

Most ratings fall between 4.0 to 4.5

Apps with 4.3–4.5 rating show the highest install frequency

Apps rated above 4.3 get ~2.5× more installs than apps below 4.1

**Category Rating Comparison:**

Finance: 4.2

Game: 4.3

Social: 4.3

**Installs Comparison:**

Finance apps: ~50K installs

Game apps: ~5M installs

Social apps: ~1M installs


# 📌Hidden Patterns Uncovered

1.**High Installs ≠ High Ratings**

Tools, Dating, and Family apps get high downloads but show lower average ratings → indicates user dissatisfaction despite popularity.

2.**App Quality Drives Growth**

Categories with high median ratings (4.3+) consistently dominate install counts.

3.**Platform Is Dominated by Free Apps**

Entire dataset contains free apps, meaning market competition relies on quality and user trust, not pricing.

4.**Rating Sweet Spot**

The 4.3–4.5 rating segment appears to be a growth trigger zone.

5.**Category Influence on Visibility**

Entertainment-oriented categories (Games, Social, Communication) naturally attract the largest user base.
